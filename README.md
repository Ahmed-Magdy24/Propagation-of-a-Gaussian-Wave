# Propagation-of-a-Gaussian-Wave
MATLAB simulation of Gaussian beam propagation using FFT-based Fourier optics. Modeled free-space evolution and reflection from a parabolic reflector, analyzing beam divergence, Rayleigh range, and wavefront curvature. Validates Gaussian beam focusing, collimation, and post-reflection behavior.
